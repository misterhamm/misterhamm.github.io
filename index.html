  <h1>Who Is This Guy?</h1>
  <p>
  So welcome to my first legit website!  It's not worth much but...well you can suck a toe.  I'm excited to be starting this journey. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I got my degree in music education and taught for a couple years which wasn't the best.  Turns out having 40 twelve year olds in a room to yourself is <em>not as easy</em> as it looks on TV.  I then went into sales as a band-aid while I tried to figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up.  That band-aid lasted almost <strong>5 years</strong>.  I finally got fed up with a job that took me away from my family and wasn't fulfilling for me.  Here I am participating in the <strong>Career Path Front End Web Developer</strong> program.  It'll be a wild ride.  Join me, won't you?

  <h1>Family</h1>
  <p>
    My family is the <strong>most important</strong> thing in the world to me.  I've been married for (almost) 11 years and have three daughters who are 7, 6, and 3.  While I certainly want to find personal satisfaction in whatever I do in life, ultimately it all comes down to my ladies!  My wife is a fantastic singer and a member of <strong>Opera Grand Rapids</strong>.  Our oldest is an avid reader and fellow geek, #2 is talented at just about everything she touches, and the little one is probably the funniest person I've ever met.

  <h1>More About Chris</h1>
  <h2>
    So three kids...do you even have time for hobbies?
  </h2>
  <p>
    Nope.  Just kidding.  While calling myself a gamer would probably be an insult to real gamers I do love me some gaming.  Primarily I play modded Minecraft.  Other interests include craft beer, woodworking, sci-fi TV, and not exercising.  At any given time you can find me playing Minecraft while smelling of wood smoke and Old Spice and wearing a Star Trek t-shirt.  
  </p>
  <h2>
    What's your dream job?
  </h2>
  <p>
    This experiment with Thinkful is the first step for me.  I'd like to come out of the program able to get a FEWD job.  Given enough time and energy, however, I'd love to creep my way into software engineering and build things like <a href="http://www.jibo.com">this</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Where are you from?
  </h2>
  <p>
    My mom's vagina?
    <br></br>
    I live in <a href="http://www.experiencegr.com">Grand Rapids, MI</a>.  If you've never had a chance to visit Grand Rapids you need to do it now.  Seriously, shut your laptop, get off your ass and come here immediately.  I'll show you around.  We have all the amenities of a larger city with the Lake Michigan beach 45 minutes away.  It's a great place to live.
